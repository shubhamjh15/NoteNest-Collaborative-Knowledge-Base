# NoteNest Frontend

This folder contains the **frontend (UI)** of NoteNest.
It is built using **Next.js** and focuses on everything the user sees and interacts with.

You do NOT need backend knowledge to contribute here.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or above)
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Run the Frontend Locally


You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts & Command Palette

### Command palette (⌘K / Ctrl+K)

Press **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+K** (macOS) from anywhere in the app to open the **command palette**. It provides fast navigation and actions without using the mouse.

- **Search:** Type to filter commands by name or keywords.
- **Navigate:** Use **↑** and **↓** to move, **Enter** to run the selected command.
- **Close:** Press **Esc** or **Ctrl+K** / **Cmd+K** again.

**Default commands (MVP):**

| Command              | Action                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Create New Note      | Go to Notes and open create modal |
| Go to Notes          | Navigate to Notes page          |
| Go to Folders        | Placeholder (navigates to Notes) |
| Focus Search         | Focus the main search input     |
| Help / Shortcuts     | Placeholder for shortcuts help   |

The palette is built to be **extensible**: you can pass a custom `commands` prop to `<CommandPalette />` or extend the default list so new features can plug in easily.

### Other shortcuts

- **/** – Focus search (when on a page that has search).
- **N** – Create note (when on Dashboard or Notes).
- **Esc** – Close overlays / clear focus.
